#Straintech
#Starintech haul truck payload system
For those that work in the mining industry and have come across a product that uses strain guages
to determine the weights on trucks may have come across a product called Straintech.

The earlier versions of their software did not allow for automated email reports. 

Using python daily payload reports and Tonnes per kms reports were created.

This required access to their MS SQL database and using email module and reportLab module to create
the required reports.
